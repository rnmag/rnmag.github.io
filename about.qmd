Hi! Data scientist and Machine Learning Engineer trained as a quantitative social scientist. I am passionate about telling stories with data, and have a keen interest in statistical modeling and visualization.

Currently acting as an independent consultant, I have also accumulated experience managing data science teams. Main strengths in this role include strategic advising and facilitating communication between technical talent and decision makers.

I am available for traveling and willing to relocate for the right opportunity.
